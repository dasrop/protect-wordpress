Protect wordpress with .htacess


Wp.config.php file:  //Se also my core - single user:)
require_once(ABSPATH.'wp-settings.php');
error_reporting(0);
ini_set('display_errors','Off');
ini_set('error_reporting',E_ALL);
define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT',true);
define('DISALLOW_FILE_MODS',true);
ob_start();
?>

Set to: 444 in wp.config.php Also gets some speed!  //imporrtant!!

* Protect: wp.contents folder, plugins,themes and uploads.
* Protect: wp-admin folder.

Core .htaccess for protection and speed.  Set: 444 files rights

* Exemple 220906 : Robots.txt - even if the wp sets up robots.txt, it is not enough! To cover all boots and if you hete:semrush, ahrefs, add more id you want


- Updated wp-content folder:)
- Updated .htaccess1 for more protection, did I cover all?

Plugins I recommend:
* limit login attempts reloaded:   See: https://wordpress.org/plugins/limit-login-attempts-reloaded/
* disable wp rest-api:  // So they cannot se who is the user: https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-wp-rest-api/
* wp-cron http auth: // Small very good protectin for  rest api:   https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-cron-http-auth/

None above takes power fron your blog:)

PAYED Firewall: 
BBQ Pro   // I love the custom - place in protection for strange files!   https://plugin-planet.com/bbq-pro/

BLOCK BAD BOTS  - Blackhole Pro   Works very well:) same adress aas above:)

404 controls: - so bad: https://www.cminds.com/wordpress-plugins-library/404-console-plugin-wordpress/
